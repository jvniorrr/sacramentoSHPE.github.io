                           I plan to base my presidency on the following principles: 
							<br>
							<br><strong> Familia & the importance of network  </strong> </br>
                            <ul> 
								<li>I want to instill trust and transparency between our members and officers on the board. </li>
							</ul>
                            <strong> Familia & the importance of network</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>I plan to emphasize the importance of the SHPE familia and how to utilize this network.</li>
								<li> I plan on inviting in other clubs, ECS or not, because have one common goal and that is to help our members be the best they can be. </li>
								<li>I plan on finding and sharing resources, such as housing, jobs, etc. so I can help our members in more ways. </li>
                            </ul>
							<strong>Self-Confidence</strong><br>
							<ul>
								<li>With the help of the officers, I want to give our members the confidence to get a job or internship. </li>
								<li>I want people to leave our meetings feeling happy and fulfilled and positive for the future, not like they wasted their time. </li>
								<li> I want members to feel like a leader, and that they have the power to take on any challenge, academically or professionally. </li>
							</ul>
							<strong>Continuity-</strong><br>
							<ul>
								<li> I shaped a lot of relationships with other ECS clubs and SHPE regional during my time on the board and would like to maintain those in the year to come. </li>
							</ul>
							I plan to create a new era for SHPE. While I’m trying not to reinvent the wheel, I want to revamp and refresh SHPE’s image into something even more welcoming and exciting.
							<br>
							I feel that I can accomplish the many goals and ideas I have with the help of the board. I want to keep focusing on professional development, but I want to explore more ways to meet members needs.

                             <p>
                            I first came to Sac State to study Civil Engineering in Fall 2015. Quickly after attending the first SHPE general meeting that year, I fell in love with the organization. I decided I wanted to create a bigger impact within my community and became the Director of Events in Fall 2016 – Spring 2017, Vice President in Fall 2017 - Spring 2018, and am currently the Director of Professional Development for Spring 2019. Now, I am ready to take on the role as your next President. I have seen how SHPE has changed over the past four years and I want to incorporate a different goal for the familia: <strong>inclusivity and growth. </strong>
							<br> <br>
							<i> “To lead is to serve, to give, to achieve TOGETHER” </i>
							<br> 
							- Katheryn E. Nelson
							<br><br>
							Surveys are a perfect example of this idea of inclusivity but online analysis of your share of thoughts is all just virtual, one-way interaction. I want to create a climate of inclusion that reflects our organization’s values and promotes an open exchange of ideas where EACH voice is heard. I want to develop an environment where everyone has a sense of belonging and to obtain that, it is essential to bring new opportunities that encourage us to interact with each other. Hosting regional events with other student and professional SHPE chapters, SHPE familia field trips and get-togethers, SHPE “Member of the Month” awards, and much more are just some activities that I want to begin incorporating this upcoming year. There is no better way to get to know someone than through a face-to-face conversation and member recognition!
							<br><br>
							<i>“Success isn’t a result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire” </i>
							<br>
							- Arnold Glasow 
							<br><br>
							I want to ensure your success in STEM as you progress into your academic career path. Workshops, company hosted general meetings, Bomba Blast, career fairs, SHPE conferences and more, are all opportunities where one can personally and professionally develop themselves and we must ensure that you are prepared for such events. Evolving into a better version of you and succeeding in all aspects of life is my mission. 
							<br><br>
							All in all, YOU are my priority.
							<br><br>
							My name is Evelyn Delgado and I want to be your Fall 2019-Spring 2020 SHPE president.
							<br><br>
							Thank you.

							 As president I am going to try to keep our membership consist, whether it be at our events or meetings. I want to get SHPE out there. As a MEP member, the vibe is that we are a family, so I want to reach out to the other MEP clubs and other engineering clubs to see if they want to do events together. Helping us get our name known more and maybe get more members, also while building a better relationship with our peers, and build better connections to network with. Another thing I want to focus on is academics, I myself am not the greatest of students, grade wise. Grades are important in school and sometimes they come in handy when you apply for internships and scholarships. If we improve little by little, that’s improvement, I believe in baby steps. I want to help members improve as a student and build connections with your fellow peers. We are a family, we have to watch ourselves succeed and support each other.

                            My name is Vanessa a current Sac State student and I’m honored to have been nominated to run as the new Vice President for the upcoming year. In preparation to step into this role, I have come to a better understanding of the responsibilities and challenges while communicating with current officers. In furthering my knowledge I noticed that one of their greatest tools is consistent communication and while I believe that there is communication from the current Vice President, it can also be improved. Some personal goals I have planned for Vice Presidency include better communication with professionals for funding and a more structured plan for the Futures Committee.
							<br> <br>
							Let me begin with funding. I found that in the past year funding was scarce and after speaking to the current Vice President he explained why. There had been a lack of communication with professionals that typically help to fund the club. As Vice President, I would make sure to keep constant communication with our professionals. Not only for funding but also to keep them as potential candidates for guest speakers should we need them. I found that some of our guest speakers weren’t as enthusiastic or relatable to our members and I think keeping a large variety of exciting guest speakers could be very helpful for the future of SHPE.
							<br> <br>
							And lastly, when a nominee becomes VP they also take on the task of guiding the Futures Committee.  My experience in the Futures Committee is what helped me gain a better understanding of the type of work it takes to become an officer, however I do wish to place a bit more structure. If made Vice President I would create a more structured committee that allows future members a better experience than I had.  I found myself stressed multiple times and felt a lack of guidance from fellow members.  Because of my experience, I’ve made it a personal goal of mine to improve the communication with the professionals and members of the club in order to progress the growth and quality of SHPE.

							If I were elected for the VP nomie I can propose a few things to SHPE that can make ourmembers and engineering program feel more connected. Not all expectations should be highwhen being practical, but a few are: have better communication among member, introducedifferent structure ideas for committees, convince more students to submit more applications,and ensure our MEP privileges are not taken away. Two main focus I believe would contributeto the club and college experience would be to i) have better communication among members,and ii) convince more students to submit more applications being posted.
							<br><br>
							Communication is important for engineers especially when exchanging ideas or simplytalking to another person. One way to improve this is suggest an app called “Slack.” Slack is agreat way to communicate with other since it’s can be downloaded on a computer, tablet and aphone. However, the unique feature it has is the freedom to create multiple boards that allowscurrent or new members to select the committee they see interesting.
							<br><br>
							It can definitely be tedious work to apply for a job, internship, or what everyone wouldwant, scholarships. With the resources offered at Sac State and the experience from theupper-class, I would like for almost all members to submit at least two applications; oneinternship and one scholarship by the end of the semester. These are two actions that canbenefit our members in the long-run both financially and maturity.

							Hi! I'm Brianna Singh, a Junior CE major. I transferred to CSUS last fall from American River College and have absolutely loved how friendly everyone has been. I&#39;m here for one more year and want to make the most of it. One way I can do that is getting involved in SHPE.
                            
							<br> <strong> Why I'm running for Treasurer: </strong>
							<br> 
							1. I've grown to love the MEP community and know SHPE is a big part of that family. It’s a tight-knit community that I appreciate being a part of.
							<br> <br>
							2. I love budgeting (said no one ever... I know). But really, I have the next ten years of my life budgeted out with contingencies and conservative rates of inflation and economic growth. I even contribute to an IRA and quasi-401k plan. Seriously, if you want help coming up with a personal budget, feel free to ask. I'd love to help!
							<br> <br>
							3. I’m good at money. Before my current job, I used to work as a bookkeeper for a construction company in San Diego, so I paid subcontractors, credit cards, invoices, and kept track of spending for a whole company. Right now I work with the Sacramento County Department of Water Resources, where I study water rights contracts, economic analysis for future land development, fee calculations, blah blah blah boring money stuff.
							<br> <br>
							4. I’m pretty boring… It’s a good thing, I promise. Think about it. You don’t want your accountant out partying all the time instead of managing your money. You want that super boring person that thinks about how they can save you more money all day and then goes to bed before 10pm. That way, YOU can go out partying because now you’ve got this big ‘ole budget at your fingertips.
							<br> <br>
							<strong> What I will do as your finance person: </strong>
							<br> <br>
							I want to make sure our club gets the most bang for our buck. As in, I want us to have the MOST FUN as we possibly can. I plan to work with the Director of Fundraising and Director of Events to come up with events that will be fun and will also make us money. For example, laser tag and escape rooms will be fun and can act as fundraising opportunities at the same time. This kind of approach will make sure we have more than enough money to go big for our main events like BBQs and galas.
							<br> <br>
							Since I’ve learned more about the position from the current Treasurer, I understand what applications need to be submitted for funding and how to apply for funding through ASI. With that prior knowledge, I will be on top of getting the funding we need from outside sources, and will also apply for whatever grants and scholarships I can on behalf of SHPE.
							<br> <br>
							Lastly, I’ll be involved. I want to be involved in SHPE and the awesome community around it. And more than that, I want to give back. The best way I can do that, is by doing what I’m best at. I’d love working in events or outreach, but I can be the most helpful as Treasurer, so that’s what I plan to do for you. If you want to know more about why I’m running and what I have in mind, feel free to reach out. I&#39;m in the MEP room often, or you can just email me at briannasingh@csus.edu. Thanks for reading!

							   My name Is Lazaro Lopez and my goal for the treasurer position is to form a trust with allmembers of SHPE in that all the finances of SHPE are put toward the benefit of its members.Having been part of this years futures committee has allowed me to to see all of the innerworkings that make SHPE tick and I feel that this has prepared me for this position and I want tocontinue to show my dedication to SHPE as I have in futures committee. Having the currenttreasure as my brother has allowed me to see the responsibilities that the position requires andwhat must get done, these consist of reimbursements, doc funding, ASI funding ,and budgetingas the main responsibilities. I feel that I am ready to take on these responsibilities because Ihave learned the inner workings of SHPE by being part of its futures committee and gettinginvolved in the planning of its events. In additions to this I also have my experience as aBusiness Major and its focus on accountancy and ethics that being in positions like theserequire.
							   <br><br>
							   I will push to work in conjunction with all the other officers to provide a great SHPEexperience to its members, whether it be in the shape a simple get together or a large eventsuch as SHPE gala, and I will work to make sure that the finances allow us to make thispossible. One of the goals that I have is to make sure that I stay informed as much as possibleas to provide SHPE with as many opportunities as possible by searching for funding andworking with the Director of fundraising and Director of events to make sure that we are able tomake money for SHPE as well as finding ways to make it worth every penny when it comes tospending.

							My plan for action as SHPE Outreach director is going to be is have many community services as possible. I want to have a lot more community service for everyone. That way we can have bonding moments with kids
							<br> <br>
							I also want to communicate to the community and help. I think that way we could expand more and we could get our club more out there. That way we could expand the way we think about others. It that helping the community is one of the biggest effects that could help us.
							<br> <br>
							I will also have the option to make way more bonding moment for the members. I think that this makes us closer to the member as well as the people that we help. I would also want to expand the option of having multiple experiments for the kid from a different major. I want to do a lot more community outreach event because I want the kid to be self-aware on what is going on. I want to make sure they can do whatever they want when they grow up. I want sure they too can make to college and be here. I want to make them love science and engineer stuff. To have a passion for something fun. These kids are the future and we need to inspire to do something great, something bigger from what they are right now.
							<br> <br>
							I am the right person for this job because I have been part of the outreach committee two now I have work with kids. I also have experience in the running part of the event of the outreach. There is also a lot of things that go behind the scene for each event. There is a lot of preparation that goes in the making of the outreach event. I am also an opened minded person and will take on a new approach as well new idea in making the events run smoother and making very interesting for the kids. I also want to give more to the program that has treated me as a family member since my first year of college

								My plan of action as director of academics would be to inform SHPE member of all the possible resources available to help us improve our academics. One of my keys to achieving high grades is using all the possible resources to their fullest potential. I want to share my knowledge of achieving high grades that I aquired throughout my years here at Sac State. Being able to get good grades as an engineering student is tough, that’s why its would be my goal to help SHPE members achieve high grades in there major. I will plan to be a mentor and tutor for SHPE members to rely on when they need help in their academics. Through out my 3 years at sac state currently I have learned a lot on what it takes to achieve high grades. Therefore, it would be my responsibility to inform and advise SHPE members on the correct steps to take in order to achieve excellent grades. As director of academics I will provide SHPE members all possible resource for tutoring available each week so that they stay informed. I would also try to provide unique events where SHPE members can use their knowledge to earn rewards. I could also try to provide incentives to students who are able to achieve the highest grades so that they stay motivated through the semester. These are just some to the goals and events I plan to do if I were to be director of academics for SHPE. I hope to be part of the familia next semester.

My plan as Director of Professional Development is to help SHPE host company information sessions, career advice, professional panel, resume workshops, career fair preparation activities, and conference preparation workshops. I want every single SHPE member to at least go to 1 regional or national conference. There are too much opportunities that are out there and I want people to use those resources to the full amount. I will do my best to guide the members into getting offers from big companies.

									Hello! As you all should know , I am your (soon-to-be-former) Webmaster. It’s been a super great yet stressful year. On this board, I feel like I have pretty much bloomed into a person that I love, I’ve actually been able to talk to new people, tried my hand at running a committee. I would really be proud to continue working on my personal growth and helping with what I could with others. So as your Historian, I ask that you let me capture your growth and your happiness in this Shpe. (Mostly so that I could get away with making a scrap book and end of the year video of everyone and not make it seem suspicious or anything.) 
									<br><br>
									My plans are pretty simple, as historian, I will capture the memories of us having fun during our events and especially during our meetings. I’d like to introduce more incentives to members who are active in taking pictures overall. In Short, everyone is already a member of my committee. 
                                    </p>

									Similar to previous Webmasters I plan on maintaining the award winning SHPE website sacshpe.org. I’d like to refresh the look with either cards or tiles. But with most priority I’d like get an app started for SHPE. Within the span of 2 days I managed to get a basic shell of an app started. Over the course of the year I’d like to continue working on it and hopefully release it so that members can be kept informed with notifications. I have several ideas but first it needs to work. My hope is to work with the other officers and members to see what other tools we may need to add. Should I be given the opportunity I’d work my best to achieve our goals.

							Goal: Teach my committee the basics of creating mobile applications using Android Studio. Finishing the academic year with a completed prototype of the committees app.
							<br><br>
							Action Steps:
							<br>
							1.(First meeting) Introduction – The first meeting will consist of pure introductions. I’d like to explain to the students my timed plan for the next academic year. However, I won’t start until everyone has introduced themselves and everyone has a general idea of who’s who.
							<br> 
							Important: We will decide if the final prototype will be by teams or as a united committee.
							<ul>
								<li> Purpose: </li>
								<ul> 
									<li> Making friends is difficult, working with strangers is even harder. I will help my students build enough level of comfort in which they can ask for help with their new committee members.</li> 
								</ul>
								<li> Boundaries:
								<ul> 
									<li> Shy Students </li>
									<li> Committee time </li>
								</ul>
								<li> Solution
								<ul>
									<li>Interact with students and always go first in order to break the ice </li>
									<li> Work on planner in order to time the meeting accordingly </li>
								</ul>
							</ul>
							2. (Second month completed) Show team’s prototypes – By now, a small prototype should be completed. This prototype will be displayed for students during our community service. We will go over our prototype with other students in SHPE in order to run tests and fix any early issues that arise.
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li> Purpose:
								<ul>
									<li>By having the committee run test on their prototype, they’re learning testing and debugging skills. Two valuable skills for any engineer or computer scientist. </li>
									<li>Testing on other SPHE members will help the committee network with one-another. </li>
								</ul>
								<li> Boundaries </li>
								<ul>
									<li> Late Prototypes </li>
								</ul>
								<li> Solution</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Weekly check-ins with proof that everyone contributed </li>
								</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>
							3.(End of the semester) Final Prototype or Product displayed – The committee will proudly present their finished mobile app during a SHPE meeting and explain its functionality. The students will also share something they’ve learned from this experience.
							<br></br>
							Final Purpose: Students will have a general idea of mobile app development. Throughout the meetings, students will acquire testing and debugging skills which are great for the tech industry. Webmaster Students will also develop communication and teamwork skills which will help in any industry.
