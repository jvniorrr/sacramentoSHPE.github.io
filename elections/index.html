                            My name is Diego Ruiz, your current Director of Events and I am running to be your President! I’ve been a part of SHPE my entire college career and want to help lead it into greater heights. My plans involve using the foundation Maria has built and developing it further. I want my term to primarily focus on you, our members, our familia. 
                            <br><br>
                            My primary goals for my term include: 
                            <br><strong>Solidifying an effective and efficient team strategy with our officers</strong><br>
                            The board is a team, one that supports each other while knowing what each individuals job is. I want to make sure each officer knows exactly what their duties are, while still having the freedom to run their position as they see fit. I will simply be a guide for them, making sure they stay on track. Our team however, is also a family. We need to make sure we’re there for each other if ones job gets tough. I will ensure that each officer has a support network and that no one person is alone in their position. Together I want to create a strategic framework to work with one another to get as much work done as possible. 
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>Creating opportunities for member involvement within the board</strong><br>
                            Most members don’t know that our officer meetings are open for you to attend. I want to make sure next year that every one of you know this and become more involved with us so we can make SHPE what you want and give you a voice in the internal workings of the board.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>Continue bringing more projects to members</strong><br>
                            Experience is everything in the engineering world, so I want to help you prepare for it by continuing to provide projects for you to gain the skillsets that are searched for throughout companies. Whether it be company tours or projects such as EEV, we will give you as many opportunities to develop the skills needed for the engineering world. 
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>Increase collaborations with other on campus clubs to improve networking</strong><br>
                            Collaborations bring networking which in turn bring opportunities. I plan to speak with leaders of other clubs and increase our involvement with them. Different clubs bring opportunities for projects, jobs, and just friends; each of which are essential to an engineer.

                                        <br><br>
                                        As SHPE President, I will continue to follow our mission and vision. In doing so, our Sac State chapter must comply with all ASI and SOAL requirements as University Policy. I will make sure to work with next year’s team to achieve these set of goals. In addition, I will continue to work with the Sac SHPE team to ensure that NRPs are submitted on time and for them to be a shining image of what we are and the quality work we do here at Sac State. I will also ensure to do my monthly conference call with regionals and nationals. As this is all the work behind the scenes, I will continue this year’s great role of presidency, Maria has done a great job leading and facilitating the officer meeting and General meetings. I will try by best to keep it at this level but hope to find new ways to make it better. My goal is to have consistent members attend our events and meetings and ensure we prepare them as professionals for their career path. This can be done by having more joint events with other professional organizations on campus, projects, tours, and conferences. Even if I don’t get elected I will continue to push my peers to their max, guide them, and build their confidence so that they may be able to do the same later some time. SHPE is not only an organization, it is a familia!

                                Hello members,	
                                <br><br>
                                As you may know my name is Gery Dawson Martinez and I would like to be your Vice President for the 2018-2019 school year. I joined SHPE in August 2017 and since then SHPE rapidly became my family. In January 2017 I became your current communications executive and I believe I have proven myself, to you all, that I take my position seriously and that I fulfilled it to the best of my ability. Being on the executive board, I have gotten a glimpse of what every position holds, and I have learned and taken into account what needs to be improved for the next school year. I have been preparing myself as your possible Vice President to improve sac SHPE and help it flourish. I know that I will be a great Vice President because of my experience and I would, again, like the opportunity to prove to you all that I will excel in the position.
                                <br><br>
                                If elected my plan of action is to push my fellow board members to help expand SHPE’s mission and vision to our members on campus and future members. Future’s committee is my opportunity to encourage members to become more involved in SHPE and leave a team of well-prepared individuals to take over SHPE after my term. I plan to work on our involvement with events that are beneficial to SHPE; and to further represent SHPE by attending important meetings and making more connections with professionals. It is instrumental that SHPE is well represented in order to gain sponsors to help us continue to grow. For us to have a strong board; we need individuals that know how to work together and have each other’s back. I know I am a team player and I won’t leave anyone in my team behind.
                                <br><br>
                                I look forward to continuing to be a key part of our family SHPE. Thank you.

                                    My name is Alyssa Rendon, and I want to be your Communications Executive. I am a first-year Computer Engineering student and in a short amount of time, SHPE has become my life. SHPE went from a simple club on campus into my network of friends and now my family.
                                    As Communications Executive, I plan to focus on deadlines, misdemeanors, organization and member interaction.

                                    I will reach all deadlines as required, such as rough drafts of the newsletter. The newsletter will be sent out on time every week. Officer deadlines will be reinforced. Appropriate misdemeanors will be given and tracked. I want to make sure our board is in order so we all can accomplish our goals and stay in line with National requirements. I will be organized and make sure all documents are in order such as making sure our meetings keep on track and are documented for future reference. I will be there for when the President or Vice President is not present. I want to improve member interaction with the board and events. I would like to create incentives for reading the newsletter or different flyers. I want to increase member enrollment by advertising events and meetings. I will communicate with members and officers to make sure they are satisfied with SHPE and their experience.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I want to make my SHPE term to be a part of the best year SHPE will ever have, and help everyone achieve their goals. SHPE is very important to me and I will do everything I can to make sure our board is successful as possible.

                                I am Jesus Lopez Reynosa, a 3rd year Computer Science student here at Sac State. I am currently the Webmaster for sacSHPE and I want to continue assisting by becoming the Treasurer for the 2018-2019 academic year. I have seen how SHPE has been able to bring people together and assist anyone who needs it. I know this because I was one of the people SHPE has helped. I have gotten awards and internships because of my involvement in SHPE and it has greatly accelerated my career. This is one of the essential features of SHPE and why I want to continue to work to assist with SHPE so that more people can experience such opportunities.
                                <br><br>
                                As Treasurer I will work my best to maintain SHPE's financies in order to continue to offer opportunities to our members and the community for as long as possible. I will make sure that paperwork gets done and efficiently without headache. My goal for this position is to allow SHPE to not have to worry about money as much, and that it can just focus on members.

                                Hello everyone! My name is Teresa Ramirez, I transferred here to Sac State about 2 years ago and I am majoring in computer science. Before transferring here, I attended Sac City College and I was never involved in any clubs there because none of them really drew me in. Once I got to Sac State, I got involved with MEP and eventually I found my way to SHPE. Within SHPE I have connected with several people not only on a personal level but also on an intellectual level. Knowing other people who understand how rigorous our majors of engineering and computer science are, is comforting. SHPE has given me a community, a sense of familia where I feel accepted and understood. 
                                <br><br>
                                It has also provided me with an opportunity to give back to the community through the outreach committee, which I have been a part of since I joined SHPE. Being a part of the outreach committee has been extremely rewarding because we get to bring smiles to the kids through fun and interactive activities. If I were to become the next outreach director, I would continue to bring creative projects that the kids can have fun with but also learn from. I am passionate about learning and would love to inspire young minds to explore the fields of engineering and all the sciences that are out there. I want to bring them concepts that they don’t normally learn in school and even if they don’t fully understand them now, maybe one day they will look back at the project they did in our STEM night or Noche de Ciencias and realize that they want to learn more about it.

                                    Hello everyone! My name is Leslie Garcia and I am currently running for the Director of Academics position within our SHPE Chapter. I am a freshman here at Sac State and have enjoyed my time here so far, especially with my SHPE familia. Just a little about myself, I currently volunteer at two elementary schools with their MESA programs and I work as an AVID tutor for the school district in West Sacramento. I’m running for Director of Academics, because I have always put my education first and with the experience I have with tutoring, I know I can help others with their academics. I know I am a freshman and don’t have the advanced education that some of the other SHPE members have, but I know that with this position I will be able to point those in need of some extra help in the right direction and learn from them too.
                                </p>

                                        Hello Everyone! I am Abel Barajas and I’m your candidate for the 2018 election for Director of Membership. As an Officer of Director of membership, I will make sure to recruit new students to our club whether they are part of Engineering, Computer Science, or any other major as we are open and willing to all students as a familia. As a Membership coordinator, I would recruit students through our SHPE Chapter weather in the STEM field or not and make sure who’s an active member in SHPE, which committee they are part of and to also track their community service or participation hours our members may have put into our club. My goal is to make sure that all of our members are active as possible even for the ones that seem to be non-active of what I can offer to them whether it be information or events that are coming up so they are not left alone or feel a disconnect from SHPE.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The reason I want to be part of the board is to give back to SHPE as it has done so much for myself and has given me many networking opportunities, community services, and committees to join that I think it’s time for me to give back to SHPE by becoming an officer. SHPE to me is like a bridge to a professional career an opportunity that not much people have, but we take for granted for. As an officer of SHPE, I feel that it comes in value as we inspire the next generation of Scientist, Engineers, and Mathematicians. I want to continue to be part of SHPE as it has helped so much that I feel the need to help this organization spread its name and to feel closer to my familia.

                                            Hello fellow SHPE members. My name is Jesse Melendez and I am a first year mechanical engineering student. Many of you don’t know me but I am a hardworking, friendly, and confident person. Even though I may not have all the experience of a returning SHPE member, I am confident that if I get elected, I will learn and grow into the officer that SHPE deserves. As Director of membership I plan on being personal with members so that I am approachable to help students relieve a little stress like many officers have helped me. Helping people is important to me because I have been helped countless amount of times by people in MEP, SHPE, and just by people on campus. I want to return the favor by helping other people out, one of the ways I want to do that is by recruiting them to SHPE and showing them that a community of accepting, similar thinking, and awesome engineers are there to help them. I believe that this club is slept on, and has some real potential to make a mark on campus and in our field specifically. I will work close with other officers to advertise SHPE all through the entry level engineering classes and if possible, to surrounding high schools with strong engineering programs. I want to thank everyone for taking me into consideration for this position and I also want to wish good luck to other candidates running for officer positions.

                                        As the Director of Professional Development, I plan to help and provide services that will prepare members to be professional as they continue through their education and learn to network through events. One of my goals to do as the professional development officer is to instruct members in preparing for networking and internships. I want to members to understand how to make things like their LinkedIn and social media accounts to be more professional especially when they are looking for internships or work. I plan to also help them prepare good cover letters on top of doing the usual resumes that are needed for companies to see. For the etiquette dinner, I plan on working with the same people but get more professional engineers to be part of the panel or even sponsor a table. This will help members talk to professional engineers even if they are from different engineering practices.  As a director of Professional Development, I will lead my committee in providing them with the tools to develop professionally also while they help their fellow.

                                        My proposal for this officer position would be to find many creative ways to host
                                        fundraiser events to raise as much money for SHPE as possible. I understand that this club does all they can to plan events for their members from Sac State and other universities, but if they are struggling financially it would lead to the event not being such a success. However, if lots of money is made through fundraising then more money would be spent for every event increasing the chance of getting SHPE members interested in attending. Also, I like reaching out to people to build connections further developing my professionalism to prepare me to attain an internship. After reaching out to SHPE alumni and corporations to sponsor us, I know that I would not only be helping out the club, but improving myself. This would be my goal that I will do my best to achieve.

                                        I did recognize that the Director of Fundraising is in charge of creating SHPE merchandise and clothing. During the beginning of middle school, I have always cared about the way I dressed, since it would be the first impression of yourself when other people see you. I would love to design clothing for this club so when our members wear it, then other college students would see that SHPE is stylish giving off a good representation of our club in that aspect.

                                        Hello Guys! My name is Oscar Arteaga, I’m a 3rd year Civil Engineer major and I’ve been in SHPE since my freshman year. I was born and raised in Guatemala, I moved to the U.S. when i was 13 and have been in California since then. I’m an energetic person, approachable, outgoing and funny. I like to joke around but also know when to keep things formal. A couple of the things I like to do is swim, dance, watch any kind of movie as long as it is not boring, and of course play soccer, which is my real passion. One of my goals as an event coordinator is to strengthen our SHPE familia ties, also break our little bubble and make more connections with different clubs and people from different majors not only engineering.

I will use my previous experience to further enhance our traditional events by providing more effective ways to throw events. I have worked with my uncle in Stockton setting up and hosting events for about 6 years shadowing and assisting him in the events. I know it is a challenge because not only do you have to learn to read the crowd, but also deal with budget and expenses. But that doesn’t mean nothing is impossible. With enough effort and help from my committee, we will be throwing fun and enjoyable events that we all can enjoy. The relationship between us SHPE members is important because in the future when we all start our careers, it will be the fellow SHPE members by your side helping you out. Thank you for reading this and I hope I have your vote for Director of Events.

                                        My plan of action as SHPE Historian is make memories for everyone in SHPE. College is once in a life opportunity and you can never take it back but the only thing that we have from college will be knowledge and pictures. Pictures are something that you can look back on and basically remember all those time and everything that happen that day. A historian has an important role as an officer in SHPE. They have to be a part of all event that SHPE will be hosting. They also have to include everyone and not only certain people. They also put a face on SHPE for everyone to see. They let the people know what we are as well as who we are. They also inform ( by the use of social media ) the member of SHPE on what is going on that day or on the weekend so the member of SHPE can be a part of. But most important they make memories for each one of us can look back upon.
                                        <br><br>
                                        My plan is to make a committee so that way we have multiple viewpoint of the event as well as to cover all the event that some of us can not make it. That way we have more picture of SHPE for SHPE. Also we can have people who want to be a part of something or enjoy taking picture of stuff to join and feel include in the SHPE familia. I would also team up with Webmaster so we can alway have an updateds picture in the front page or keep adding picture to our website like a galley. The idea of having an slideshow will be awesome idea as well for that I am going to need committee to help out make one. That way we can divide the work instead pinning on one person.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I am a great person for this position because I am very open minded to new idea in how to make Historian a great committee to join. I am also very welcoming to other people and you need someone to bring in new people to SHPE and to feel that they are welcome to the Familia. I also have experience in leadership . That is also very important because I need to be able to have leadership toward the group of people that I am running. I also will feel like I am giving back to the program that I enjoy to be a part of.

                                        Hello my name is Adrian Sanchez and I am running for Historian of SHPE for the Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 academic year. As Historian I would help SHPE keep record of the club's accomplishments and activities. The Historian committee would be close to most committees and collaborate ideas with members to help our chapter develop better understandings of our mission. As a Hispanic engineering major, the SHPE famila  at Sac State is deep in my heart and that is why I am motivated to help make SHPE a memorable place for all members, as well as feel welcomed and supported.

                                        Hello everyone! My name is Renan Jauregui and I am about to complete my first year at Sac State. I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering and I am going to minor in Computer Science. I told myself that when I go to college I want to be more active in my community and step out of my comfort zone. I am an introvert and so I usually don’t talk much and keep things to myself but I believe if I get the Historian position it will help me open up, develop my communication skills and I will have a good time. If I get this position I will make sure that I will get SHPE’s name out there and making sure we have memories to look back on and just see how good things were and will continue to be good. I will make sure you enjoy the nostalgia brought on by the pictures I will take and show how well the SHPE community is and will continue to be a great community. I can’t thank you enough for the opportunities I have been given. Thank you good people of America.
                                    </p>

                                        Hello, my name is Madina Srey and I am a Junior majoring in Comptuer Science. As Webmaster, I will be responsible for maintaining the image of SHPE through the digital world. I want to create a more user friendly website that would effectively give our members what they need to know. To do so, I plan to work with all the officers to ensure that I have all the information to update on the SHPE website.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Another plan I want to implement is to give my committee a set of skills that they will be able to use for their resumes or as something they can show to potential employers. To do this, I plan to show my committee how to redesign their individual ECS webpage using PHP. I have been in the Webmaster committee for quite some time and I know that this is a hard committee to keep up with because not everyone has the skills or knowledge to build or maintain a website. I envision that the outcome will give my committee at least the basic knowledge of building a website in order to build up to a beautiful resume, have something to brag about among the professionals or with their peers, or to just have as a hobby. I also hope that this plan will not only bring Computer Science or Computer Engineer majors to the table, but hopefully making a webpage will sound welcoming to all majors. With how fast technology is evolving, knowing just a little bit of coding is a skill everyone should have because it could come in handy one day.
                                        <br><br>
                                        So to recap, I think I am a great candidate for Webmaster because we need someone to keep our digital faces looking beautiful and attractive for our potential members. Next, I am willing to work hard so that everyone in my committee can come in knowing nothing, and leave with a little something to show the world.
