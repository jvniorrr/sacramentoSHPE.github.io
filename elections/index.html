                        <li>I plan on inviting other clubs, ECS or not because they have one common goal and that is to help our members be the best they can be.</li>
                        <li>I plan on finding and sharing resources, such as housing, jobs, etc. so I can help our members in more ways.</li>

                        <li>I plan to create a new era for SHPE. While I’m trying not to reinvent the wheel, I want to revamp and refresh SHPE’s image into something welcoming and exciting.</li>

                      Hello everyone. I plan on running for the Vice President position at SHPE. I have previous experience as a board member of SHPE at San Joaquin Delta College. The position I held was president and I managed to increase membership while regaining a previously lost project. Once I become Vice President, I plan on taking the initiative and start planning fundraisers with the Director of Fundraising. I understand how important money is for the club. If our STAR members need some help for the conferences, we could help them out. I also plan on working closely with the Director of Outreach. I have previous experience recruiting members of the club and informing them about SHPE. I will maintain the current professional relationships we have with companies and speakers. I am familiar with the responsibilities of the president so if he is ever unavailable, I will be able to back him up. I plan getting familiar with Sac system and organizations in order to be able to take a bigger leadership position later. In order to do so I will be attending all the meetings with the ECSSJC. I am not planning on becoming president. After I get familiar with the Sac system, I plan on joining the regional SHPE board. Once I am there, I will be able to bring attention back to Sacramento and hopefully have us host RLDC again.

                      My name is Maria and my preferred pronouns are they/them. I feel honored to be given the opportunity to be nominated for SHPE treasurer. I am a second year student currently working towards my bachelor’s degree in computer engineering. I am thankful that I found a home within the STEM community and SHPE. Today I am running for the position of treasurer to no only complete my duties but also continue to help build the same essence of family that drew me in. I will ensure that SHPE is always first when it comes to finances. The treasure’s responsibility is to represent SHPE in front not only ASI but also other chapters. As treasurer I will push for the monetary needs of our SHPE familia. Thank you to Jesus and Lazaro Lopez for answering any questions I had and offering more insight on the behind the scene responsibilities a SHPE treasurer must do. I also want to work with all of the officers to make sure returning and new members feel welcome. To be more specific, enforce a buddy system that will help new members transition into our familia easier and focus on more important goals. Once I was able to break the awkward stage of meeting new people within SHPE, I started to feel more comfortable and confident in asking for help. As a first generation latinx member stepping out of my comfort is something I come across all the time but that doesn’t make it any easier. Thank you once again for the opportunity to run for treasurer and being a member of the SHPE familia.

                        I’ve been part of SHPE for several years, from high school, to community college, to here in
                      Sacramento State. I have worked as Treasurer for SHPE of Napa Valley Community College (2017-2018) and I plan to be CSUS SHPE’s Treasurer so I can continue to spread SHPE’s message. I want to become Treasurer because I believe I’m the most qualified and most dedicated to managing the club’s finances. As a dedicated financial officer, I have skills in Excel and I will work to maximize club benefits such as quality of events/advertisement while minimizing excess/unnecessary spending to maintain our funds high. I will work closely with the fundraiser coordinator to ensure that we have fun and profitable fundraisers, with a focus on fundraising traditional holiday celebrations such as Dia de los Muertos to sell traditional Mexican bread donated/bought from a local bakery with chocolate abuelita. Through volunteering, we can grow the club’s memberships/engagement so I will work to get members involved with club activities. Alongside the other officers, I will also ensure clear communication amongst members and non-members. This includes communications via posters, emails, discord, and through general meetings on full-details of events/fundraisers, and other useful information that will offer members opportunities to grow in there academic and professional careers. I will work to make SHPE commonly known for creating relationships and extending students’ professional networks by working with the San Francisco professional chapter and other nearby college SHPE chapters. Students may connect with professionals and students from Sacramento or other cities that can potentially benefit them in the future. Following my time as Treasurer, I hope to go further and become the President or VP of CSUS SHPE chapter.

Students should have a comfortable environment such that their course work is the least they worry about. Essentially, I propose to give resources to the students so that they can worry on other attributes of their professional career such as resume building or mock interviewing.
                      <br><br>
                      As director of academics it is imperative to have a plan so that individuals have an idea of what to expect when coming to you for help. Initially I intend to make the position known to the entire discourse community and give background information of what director of academics does. For instance, providing resources such as tutoring and holding study sessions. Thereafter, I would conduct a survey to see the availability of other people and optimistically rearrange my schedule to fit their needs. Making an announcement prior to each general meeting I will inform everyone of potential study hours and give the indication that if there are some individuals who are shy and timid that they are also welcomed to approach me after the meeting. I will also confer with other officers to provide the best experience SHPE can offer. There are several resources that can be utilized and throughout the semester I will inform students of what they are. It is ideal to think that we as officers are resources as well and therefore, I will make myself disposable at the luxury of the students. Prioritizing school first would allow other students to take advantages of the resources on campus.
                      <br><br>
                      Providing individuals with a table chart that can be used as a study habit will be the first resource implemented. Although not mandatory, I implore everyone to take advantage; as with the other resources. Sacramento State offers a wide spectrum of resources that are implemented to aid individual’s success. Having worked within the university, I am extremely knowledgeable in what kind of recourses are offered. To elaborate, everyone comes from a different background and therefore I would accommodate accordingly. To name a couple that I strongly argue are the mot popular, Lassen hall offers resources that involve financial inquiry. Santa Clara ECS helpdesk offers tutoring services for all ECS majors. Additionally, the well utilizes the help of counselors to address mental health, which is crucial in a student’s life. Other resources can be found through the Sacramento state website. Though in this section I explained vey briefly, upon an encounter with an individual, I would elaborate in explicit detail what these resources are. I must reiterate that having experience within student resource, I understand how helpful they are and the academic achievement I have at with taking advantage of them.
                      <br><br>
                      I must also state that I will be extremely accommodating as I understand individual having very tight schedules and the study session, I offer will not suit them. Therefore, I will reevaluate the survey initially conducted and rearrange as well as update all involved.

                      My name is Jorge Luis Escobar Jr. and I am currently a second year Civil Engineer student. Before I get into my plan of action as the Officer of Membership, I would like to give you guys a couple of interests of mine. I am a very athletic and competitive person and enjoy playing any type of games with my friends or group. Another thing is that I am a sociable person and enjoy talking and getting the chance to meet new people.  Through my years in college, I have been a part of the SHPE “Familia” and have been in two committee led by two great officer who taught me a lot. In this committees, I understood and took mental notes on what it takes to be an officer. Now that you know a little about me, I would like to explain my plan of action as the Officer of Membership. I would like to find a way to use our key fobs to make signing into the meetings more efficient for both the members and the officers. I also would like to create some sort of program in Microsoft Excel, so that I can keep track of the members that have been going to the meetings and which have met the requirements to be a full member of SHPE.  This program will allow me to be organized so that if anyone needs to know their status, they can contact me and find out quickly. My friends and companions have told me that I am organized, and I feel with this trait I will be able to be a great Officer of Membership.

                      As the nominee for the Director of Membership, some of the goals I have in mind is to make sure that the people present to the meetings are accounted for. As a member of SHPE, I have noticed that the attendance routine is not efficient I’d like it to be. Often times it takes too long to get checked in because of the lack of devices. One idea I have to make things run efficiently is to create a QR code that leads directly to the attendance sheet. By doing so I believe that taking attendance will go faster because people always carry around a mobile device. I want to run for this position because I believe it is the role for me. I am well organized and I have had experience mitigating attendance.

                      As a junior chapter representative, I would like to make it easy for SHPE members to
                      complete their community service hours, as well as, help the students from the junior chapter to figure out what field of engineering they would like to study. I plan to do this by having at least one event a month. That gives SHPE members plenty of opportunities to get their community service hours completed. As for helping the students from the Junior Chapter I would like to have each event focus on a different field of engineering. When I was in high school, I was struggling to figure out what field of engineering I wanted to go into. It wasn’t until I had done many projects in my engineering class that had helped me decide what I wanted to major in. By having different events, I can give these students some insight as to what each field does. For example, one event can be centered around Arduinos to interest students into computer science or computer engineering. Another event can be centered around building the strongest bridge to get students into civil engineering. I could also ask other SHPE members from different fields what projects relating to their fields would interest students. Overall, as the Junior Chapter Representative I would like to make it easy for current SHPE members to complete their community service hours. I also plan to help students find out what engineering field they are passionate about by having a variety of events be focused on different fields.
