                    <p>
                     Hello my name is Mar and my pronouns are they/them/theirs. I am running for the president position for SHPE this upcoming school year. <br>
                     I have been a member of SHPE for two years and an officer for one. I have been on both ends of the sword which has given me knowledge on what our members will benefit from the most and how to execute these ideas effectively. Being an officer for one year and shadowing our current president helped me understand what goes on behind the scenes. I have also gained leadership skills being social chair for the Engineering and Computer Science Joint Council (ECsJC) which communicates with the entire student body of our college. Engaging with my peers on a larger scale has facilitated my communication with faculty members such as, the associate dean. This allowed me to be more aware of important club deadlines that were crucial to the conventions a lot of our members were able to attended cost free. I have also attended meetings from other minority organizations such as our wonderful Latinx Council. I was able to gather resources and events from other clubs not necessarily STEM related but important resources specifically for the minority groups we are part of. The latest position I have taken on is being an operations team member for Sac Hacks. I am thankful for being part of such different organizations because they each have given a wider perspective on how to take on such a demanding position.<br>
                     My plan is to continue all the work the current board has executed throughout these unprecedented times. I would like to continue using virtual platforms (Discord) to ease communication with our members. However, I would encourage all officers to be more interactive on the various channels to facilitate communication even more. Another great positive outcome were the interactions made with other university and professional chapters. I would like to continue nurturing these relationships but also creating new ones to expand our SHPE familia. <br>
                     Focusing on our SHPE familia will be my number one priority. I plan on executing this by listening to their needs and creating solutions. This year, I came across an alumni who mentioned to me some needs they which would’ve been met while they were in Sac State and part of SHPE. They found that some of our resources were not catered to DACA recipient. Some scenarios are different for DACA students than the average people. I took on the initiative by reaching out organizations that help STEM DACA people and plan on making these resources available for whoever may need them. I want to ensure every member has the opportunity to express their needs and that our team of officers will create new workshops/committees/ meetings/etc that will meet those needs, regardless of their personal or academic background. <br>
                      As for improving officer communication, I would create 4 different teams among us, mixing returning and new officers. This will allow the new officers to have a direct line of communication to those who have already done this before. <br>
                      I will not try to improve on what has already been perfected but I will also create new doors of opportunity for our members to go through. Thank you for letting me serve you as treasurer this year and I look forward to having the opportunity to be your president next year.

                      Hi, my name is Philip, and I would like to run for the position of SHPE Communications Executive! And thus, here is my plan of action. Let first me talk about my qualifications. Firstly, I have SHPE experience as the Junior Chapter Representative where I communicated between the Junior chapter and our chapter here on campus. I would have to send emails or texts to the person in charge at Cristo Del Rey high school and then when events were done or if they needed funds, I would communicate these details over to the board in our meetings or in email depending on the needs. I am also going to be a junior this semester and I have a fair amount of experience when it comes to talking to professionals and peers, whether that be over email or in person! I also have plenty of photoshop experience, which means that I will have no problems doing the promotions for the newsletters and such. If I am elected there would be some cool things I would like to try. Firstly, I would like to possibly revamp the announcements. Ways this could be done is by making cleaner graphics or changing certain elements every month (kind of like the holiday newsletter, but more frequent). Another way this can be done, which I am hoping would work is by doing video announcements. However, this does depend on us being on campus, so that is something I would like to try if classes are on campus next academic school year. I feel like the content of the letters is fine, but there used to be uplifting humor in them, so I would like to bring that back. I have been in many a meeting minutes, so I know what I need to do for those, and once I am the Coms. Exec. I will be sure to make those as fun as possible while maintaining the professional aspect that we strive for.

                     As the nominee for the Director of Academics, my goal is to provide various resources and guidance to students to help them achieve their personal and academic goals. As the Director of Academics, I would make it my responsibility to inform SHPE members about open scholarship opportunities and skills from time management to study skills through emails and social media platforms. 
I plan to have open study sessions per week as a place or time, if we are virtual, where students can come and join to get their work done without any disturbance. I also welcome SHPE members to contact me as a resource to provide them with the right guide to their questions. Additionally, I would inform the students about ECS and University tutoring services and the ECS help center located in Santa Clara. I believe that if students know about the resources provided to them, then they will tend to use those services for their success.

                      My name is Jorge Luis Escobar Jr. and I am currently a second year Civil Engineer student. Before I get into my plan of action as the Officer of Membership, I would like to give you guys a couple of interests of mine. I am a very athletic and competitive person and enjoy playing any type of games with my friends or group. Another thing is that I am a sociable person and enjoy talking and getting the chance to meet new people.  Through my years in college, I have been a part of the SHPE “Familia” and have been in two committee led by two great officer who taught me a lot. In this committees, I understood and took mental notes on what it takes to be an officer. Now that you know a little about me, I would like to explain my plan of action as the Officer of Membership. I would like to find a way to use our key fobs to make signing into the meetings more efficient for both the members and the officers. I also would like to create some sort of program in Microsoft Excel, so that I can keep track of the members that have been going to the meetings and which have met the requirements to be a full member of SHPE.  This program will allow me to be organized so that if anyone needs to know their status, they can contact me and find out quickly. My friends and companions have told me that I am organized, and I feel with this trait I will be able to be a great Officer of Membership.

                      As the nominee for the Director of Membership, some of the goals I have in mind is to make sure that the people present to the meetings are accounted for. As a member of SHPE, I have noticed that the attendance routine is not efficient I’d like it to be. Often times it takes too long to get checked in because of the lack of devices. One idea I have to make things run efficiently is to create a QR code that leads directly to the attendance sheet. By doing so I believe that taking attendance will go faster because people always carry around a mobile device. I want to run for this position because I believe it is the role for me. I am well organized and I have had experience mitigating attendance.

                      As a junior chapter representative, I would like to make it easy for SHPE members to
                      complete their community service hours, as well as, help the students from the junior chapter to figure out what field of engineering they would like to study. I plan to do this by having at least one event a month. That gives SHPE members plenty of opportunities to get their community service hours completed. As for helping the students from the Junior Chapter I would like to have each event focus on a different field of engineering. When I was in high school, I was struggling to figure out what field of engineering I wanted to go into. It wasn’t until I had done many projects in my engineering class that had helped me decide what I wanted to major in. By having different events, I can give these students some insight as to what each field does. For example, one event can be centered around Arduinos to interest students into computer science or computer engineering. Another event can be centered around building the strongest bridge to get students into civil engineering. I could also ask other SHPE members from different fields what projects relating to their fields would interest students. Overall, as the Junior Chapter Representative I would like to make it easy for current SHPE members to complete their community service hours. I also plan to help students find out what engineering field they are passionate about by having a variety of events be focused on different fields.
