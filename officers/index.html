                Hey everyone! I am your current President for the 2018-2019 year! I am a 4th year Mechanical Engineer and have been a part of this organization since i first started college in 2015. I chose to become a Mechanical Engineer due to my upbringing in a dairy. I originally come from a tiny town named Burrel, somewhat near Fresno, where I would help my dad with working on the dairy behind our house. Being exposed to large machines when I was young caused me to be fascinated in the internal workings of all things. 
				When I joined SHPE, it wasn't exactly willingly. I was kind of absorbed into the first Futures Committee (the best one yet!). However, once I began meeting more people, I knew this was going to be my new family. Ever since then I’ve been an active member and am now holding my second officer position.

                How’s it going SHPEmates! I’m your current Vice President this school year and I’m majoring in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Growing up I have always been interested in the new tech and how they work. It wasn’t till high school, when I took Physics, where I would ultimately decide my career path. 
				Ever since I have joined SHPE, it has helped shape the person I am today. I have taken advantage of virtually every opportunity that has been thrown my way. I hope you all will do the same. Since I have gained a lot from being apart of the SHPE familia, I wanted to give back as well. Which is why I continued being an officer. If you have any questions about SHPE or anything else, feel free to ask. Welcome to the SHPE familia!

                Hello SHPE!! I am the current Communications Executive, meaning I send out the lovely newsletters that everyone reads and take care of a lot of behind the scenes stuff! I am a Computer Engineering major and a very huge nerd. I love everything about technology, from fixing to creating new things! (Lets build robots!). I’m originally from Michigan, so from attending all the conferences such as HENAAC, RLDC, and NILA and our general meetings, SHPE has given me a professional network and a family. With SHPE, I got my first internship my first year here, and I’m just so excited to be apart of the board!

				Hello everyone! My name is Teresa Ramirez and I am your current Director of Outreach. I am majoring in Computer Science and I am hoping to graduate in Fall 2019 or Spring 2020. Growing up in the era where technology was becoming more and more relevant to our daily lives really stuck with me. I was constantly mind boggled by it all and I wondered how it all worked, this was essentially the reason that lead me to purse a degree in Computer Science.
				When I transferred to Sac State in the Fall of 2016, I wanted to get involved with campus clubs and really put myself out there. Being the shy person that I am, I was overwhelmed during the first meeting because I had to participate in the ice breaker. Even though it was out of my comfort zone, I still wanted to go back and be a part of such an amazing organization. SHPE has challenged me to break out of my shell and to take any opportunity to better myself. I hope that we can inspire you all and help you reach your goals!

				Hello everyone, I’m your Director of Academics this year. I am currently a second year Electrical & Electronics Engineering major. I was fortunate enough to attend an elementary school that exposed me to engineering from a young age. I started with MESA in 6th grade and continued with the program through high school which directed me towards the electrical and mechanical/robotics programs at the high school. I then decided to stick with electrical and haven’t looked back. I now volunteer at both the elementary and the high school with their STEM programs, clubs, and academies.
				I joined MEP as a freshman last year and they lead the way to SHPE. At first I was shy and didn’t really talk to many of the other members, but as we got to know each other SHPE became more and more like family. I am excited for what this year has to bring and to be able to grow with our SHPE familia.

                  Hello everyone! I am Abel Barajarajas and I am your Director of Membership for SHPE this year, im currently a third year at Sacramento State pursuing in the Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering. I am currently on my third year of commuting everyday from Stockton to Sacramento, but it’s the strive of commitment and dedication that keeps me going an hoping to move out soon. For my freetime I usually like to watch anime, netflix, and youtube as for my exercise free time would be dancing latin music or playing racquetball. What lead me to my major was the fact that I want to help out my community rebuild the infrastructure as much as they helped me out to pursue my education. What SHPE has done for me is give me professional experience, helped me get out of my comfort zone, and networking with others that I never believed I would meet (like Jose M. Hernandez). Hopefully you guys will be satisfied as what SHPE has to offer and that you join our great Familia.</div>

I am the Jr. Chapter Representative for this academic year, and my job is to keep the communication between our SHPE Jr. Chapter at a local high School with our university chapter here at Sac State. We help organize events for the highschool students as well as support their STEM Project Days. I joined SHPE 2 years ago, and am so grateful that I did. Here I have grown so much both as a professional and individual, but I am most thankful for the long-lasting friendships and memories I have made with my SHPE familia. This next year is going to be incredibly exciting, and I hope that you too get the best of what SHPE can offer!
